# Water Polo Champions League

This project is inspired by the Elo ratings used by [fivethirtyeight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/sports/) (and many others) to rank sports teams and quantify the probable outcomes of future sporting events. In this case, I am ranking and making predictions for the teams in the water polo Champions League competition.

The data used in the project was scraped from [flashscore.com](https://www.flashscore.com/water-polo/europe/champions-league/results/), covering the competitions from 2008-present. I used Selenium tools with the Beautiful Soup library in Python to scrape the data. The analysis of the data was done using standard Python libraries, and the results are displayed on a Tableau [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/WaterPoloChampionsLeague2008-Present/CurrentSeason).
